The Clinical Trials Access Collaborative focuses on expanding participation in clinical research by improving awareness, accessibility, and trust among underserved communities. 
Through partnerships across industry, healthcare, community groups, and regulators, the initiative redesigned referral pathways, strengthened provider support, and used digital tools to streamline participation. 
Pilot programs showed clear increases in patient inquiries, referrals, and successful enrollments. 
This collaborative approach provides a scalable model for equitable access to clinical trials and ensures future treatments benefit diverse populations.
