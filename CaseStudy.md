Clinical Trials Access Collaborative aims to make clinical research more inclusive by addressing barriers that prevent many patients from joining trials. 
The initiative brings together life sciences companies, healthcare providers, advocacy groups, and regulators to expand participation and close long-standing access gaps.

Today, many groups remain underrepresented in clinical research due to limited awareness, logistical challenges, mistrust, or lack of local trial sites. 
This restricts scientific understanding and impacts the development of treatments that work for diverse populations. 
McKinsey and partners studied these gaps and co-created a collaborative model to improve availability, enrollment, and retention.

The team identified major structural challenges, including low community engagement, inconsistent referral pathways, fragmented provider information, and limited digital enablement. 
The collaborative used a systematic approach: mapping access barriers, evaluating patient and clinician pain points, and designing practical interventions to increase participation.

Key solutions focused on empowering providers with better trial information, improving referrals, working closely with community organizations, increasing transparency, and using technology to simplify onboarding. 
The collaborative emphasized equitable outreach and culturally relevant communication. Digital tools helped patients find trials faster while reducing administrative burden.

Pilot programs across different health systems delivered clear evidence of impact. Clinical trial inquiries increased significantly, referral rates improved, and more patients successfully enrolled. 
Providers reported better support and clearer processes, while communities responded positively to targeted awareness efforts.

This collaborative approach shows how industry, public-sector players, and healthcare organizations can come together to solve access challenges. 
It demonstrates that improving clinical trial participation requires partnership, trust building, and continuous evaluation. 
The model offers a scalable blueprint to expand equity in research and ensure new treatments serve everyone.
